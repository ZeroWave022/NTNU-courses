Course info available in [Norwegian](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TDT4100) and [English](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4100).

All materials will be posted in their original language. In this case, this is Norwegian.

Each assignment in `src/main/java` has two folders. The `solutions` folder contains my own solutions and `suggested-solutions` are the solutions provided by the institution after the delivery deadline.

The tests located in `src/test/java` test my own solutions (those found in the `solutions` folder in each assignment).
