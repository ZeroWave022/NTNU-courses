# Course TDT4109 - Information Technology, Introduction

Course info available in [Norwegian](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TDT4109) and [English](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4109).

All materials will be posted in their original language. In this case, this is Norwegian.

Originally, each assignment had an `assets` folder.
This has been moved, as it seems to include the same assets for all assignments and the links inside the Jupyter notbooks have been updated.

Each assignment has three folders. The `tasks` folder contain the tasks themselves, the `solutions` folder contains my own solutions and `suggested-solutions` are the solutions provided by the institution after the delivery deadline.
